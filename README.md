## About the Project

HTTP3 is a revolutionary decentralized web hosting platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide permanent, censorship-resistant website hosting. It combines the power of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) with smart contracts to create a robust, decentralized infrastructure for the web.

### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`DATABASE_URL`

`PRIVATE_KEY`

`GEMINI_API_KEY`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses npm as package manager

```bash
 npm install --global npm
```

### Installation

Install HTTP3 with npm

```bash
  npm install http3
  cd http3
```

### Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```

### Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/http3.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd http3
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

### Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run build
  npm run start
```

## Usage

1. Connect your Web3 wallet to the platform.
2. Navigate to the Dashboard to deploy a new website or manage existing ones.
3. Use the AI Website Generator to create a website quickly.
4. Deploy your website to the decentralized network.
5. Monitor your website's performance and analytics.
6. Participate in the token economy by staking and earning rewards.

Here's a basic example of deploying a website:

```javascript
import { createWebpage } from "@/utils/db/actions";

async function deployWebsite(userId, domain, content) {
  try {
    const { webpage, txHash, cid, deploymentUrl } = await createWebpage(
      userId,
      domain,
      content
    );
    console.log(`Website deployed successfully. URL: ${deploymentUrl}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Deployment failed:", error);
  }
}
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement basic website deployment
- [x] Integrate with IPFS
- [x] Develop smart contract for storing website metadata
- [ ] Implement token economy
- [ ] Enhance analytics and monitoring features

Contributions are always welcome!

### Code of Conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/yourusername/http3/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## FAQ

- How is my website stored on the blockchain?

  - Your website content is stored on IPFS, and the IPFS hash (CID) is stored on the blockchain along with metadata about your website.

- Can I update my website after deployment?
  - Yes, you can update your website content at any time. Each update will create a new IPFS hash, which will be recorded on the blockchain.
